# Salescience Data Acquisition and Processing System Architecture

This document captures architecture decisions and enhancement plans for the Salescience data acquisition and processing layers.

## Current Architecture

### Data Acquisition Layer

The data acquisition layer is responsible for:
- Fetching data from external sources (SEC EDGAR, Yahoo Finance)
- Standardizing the data into consistent envelopes
- Publishing data to Redis streams for downstream processing
- Tracking job status and results

Key components:
- `sec_client.py`: Handles SEC EDGAR API interactions (10-K, 10-Q, 8-K, Form 4 filings)
- `yahoo.py`: Handles Yahoo Finance API interactions
- `worker.py`: Asynchronous job processing with task queuing
- `utils.py`: Shared utilities for Redis keys, logging, etc.

Current capabilities:
- Multi-company data fetching
- Multi-user support with organization isolation
- Asynchronous job processing
- Redis-based job status tracking
- Optional Prometheus metrics

### Processing Layer (Future Integration with Reducto AI)

The processing layer will be responsible for:
- Extracting structured data from raw filings
- Performing natural language processing on financial documents
- Generating insights and analytics
- Storing processed data for retrieval

Reducto AI integration potential:
- Document parsing and entity extraction
- Financial data extraction from unstructured text
- Semantic analysis of financial statements
- Trend analysis and anomaly detection
- Cross-company comparisons and benchmarking

## Implementation Approaches

### For Data Acquisition Layer Resilience:

Approach 1: Standalone Resilience Module
- Create separate resilience.py module
- Import and use in each client file
- Pros: Clean separation of concerns
- Cons: Additional import dependencies

Approach 2: Direct Enhancement of Existing Files (Recommended)
- Enhance sec_client.py and yahoo.py directly
- Add resilience patterns into the existing code
- Pros: Simpler file structure, less refactoring
- Cons: Mixing concerns within files

### For Processing Layer with Reducto AI:

Approach 1: API Client Integration
- Create Reducto API client similar to SEC client
- Send documents to Reducto's API for processing
- Retrieve and store structured results
- Pros: Clean separation, minimal changes to architecture
- Cons: Network latency, API rate limiting

Approach 2: Embedded Integration
- Integrate Reducto SDK directly into processing layer
- Process documents locally using Reducto models
- Pros: Lower latency, no API constraints
- Cons: Larger deployment footprint, model management overhead

### For Resilient API Communication

```python
# In sec_client.py

def get_cik_for_ticker(ticker: str, request_id: str = None, max_retries: int = 3) -> str:
    """
    Enhanced version with retry logic, circuit breaker, and request tracing.
    """
    attempt = 0
    delay = 1.0
    
    while attempt < max_retries:
        try:
            # Add request ID to logs
            logger.info(f"[{request_id}] Resolving ticker '{ticker}' to CIK via sec-api.io (attempt {attempt+1}/{max_retries})")
            
            # Set timeout explicitly
            resp = httpx.get(url, timeout=10.0, headers={"X-Request-ID": request_id})
            
            # Handle response...
            return padded_cik
            
        except Exception as e:
            attempt += 1
            if attempt >= max_retries:
                logger.error(f"[{request_id}] Max retries reached for ticker '{ticker}': {e}")
                raise
                
            # Exponential backoff with jitter
            jitter = 0.1 * delay * (random.random() * 2 - 1)
            delay = min(delay * 2 + jitter, 30.0)
            
            logger.warning(f"[{request_id}] Retrying in {delay:.2f}s: {e}")
            time.sleep(delay)
```

### For Request Tracing

```python
# In utils.py

def generate_request_id() -> str:
    """Generate a unique request ID for tracing."""
    return str(uuid.uuid4())

class TracingLogger:
    """Logger that includes request ID in all messages."""
    
    def __init__(self, logger_name: str):
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(logger_name)
        
    def info(self, message: str, request_id: str = None, **kwargs):
        """Log at INFO level with request ID."""
        if request_id:
            message = f"[{request_id}] {message}"
        self.logger.info(message, extra=kwargs)
        
    # Similar methods for debug, warning, error, etc.
```

### For Worker Enhancement

```python
# In worker.py

class WorkerManager:
    """Manages worker processes and health monitoring."""
    
    def __init__(self, redis_client, worker_id=None):
        self.redis_client = redis_client
        self.worker_id = worker_id or str(uuid.uuid4())
        self.last_heartbeat = 0
        
    async def start_heartbeat(self):
        """Start sending heartbeats to Redis."""
        while True:
            try:
                self.redis_client.hset(
                    "worker:heartbeats", 
                    self.worker_id, 
                    json.dumps({
                        "timestamp": time.time(),
                        "status": "active",
                        "jobs_processed": self.jobs_processed,
                        "memory_usage": psutil.Process().memory_info().rss
                    })
                )
                self.last_heartbeat = time.time()
            except Exception as e:
                logger.error(f"Failed to send heartbeat: {e}")
                
            await asyncio.sleep(10)  # Send heartbeat every 10 seconds
            
    async def check_for_dead_workers(self):
        """Check for dead workers and recover their jobs."""
        # Implementation details...
```
